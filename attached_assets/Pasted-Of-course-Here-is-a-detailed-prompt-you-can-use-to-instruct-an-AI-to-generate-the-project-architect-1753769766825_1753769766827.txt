Of course. Here is a detailed prompt you can use to instruct an AI to generate the project architecture, incorporating connections to relevant open-source GitHub repositories.

AI Project Generation Prompt
Objective: Create a detailed architectural plan and foundational code structure for a full-stack web application that transforms user-uploaded PDF documents into immersive, AI-illustrated digital books. The core feature is to analyze the PDF's text to generate thematic "marginalia" (small drawings in the margins) that match the content's genre, topics, and mood. The final output should be a book-like web interface with a page-turning effect.

The entire architecture should prioritize the use of robust, open-source projects available on GitHub.

I. Core System Architecture

Design a three-pillar, asynchronous architecture:

Frontend: A modern JavaScript single-page application (SPA).

Backend: A Python-based processing pipeline.

AI Services: A combination of third-party APIs and self-hosted open-source models.

The backend must be asynchronous to handle long-running tasks. Implement a task queue system (e.g., Celery with Redis) to decouple the initial file upload from the intensive AI processing pipeline. The user should upload a PDF, receive a job ID immediately, and be able to poll for the status until the illustrated book is ready to be rendered.

II. Backend Implementation (Python)

PDF Content Extraction:

Primary Engine: Use PyMuPDF for high-speed, layout-aware text extraction. Reference the pymupdf/PyMuPDF repository on GitHub. The goal is to extract structured text blocks with coordinates to accurately reconstruct paragraphs and calculate margin space for each page.   

Fallback for Complex Layouts: Integrate the unstructured.io library as a secondary strategy for PDFs with complex, multi-column layouts or embedded tables. Reference the Unstructured-IO/unstructured GitHub repository.   

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline:

Text Chunking: Implement semantic chunking to create thematically coherent text segments. Use the SemanticChunker from the LangChain framework. Reference the langchain-ai/langchain-community GitHub repository.   

Thematic Analysis:

Genre/Theme Identification: Use a zero-shot classification model from the Hugging Face Transformers library (huggingface/transformers ) to identify the primary genre (e.g., Fantasy, Sci-Fi, History).   

Topic Modeling: Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover latent topics and keywords within the text. Implement this using the gensim library, referencing the piskvorky/gensim GitHub repository.   

Mood Detection: Use an emotion detection model, also from the Hugging Face Transformers library, to analyze the emotional tone of each text chunk.

Text Embedding Service:

Design a pluggable service for generating text embeddings.

For the open-source implementation, create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint that serves open-source models locally. Use the open-text-embeddings project from GitHub (limcheekin/open-text-embeddings ). This service should host a high-performance model like    

all-mpnet-base-v2 from the sentence-transformers library (UKPLab/sentence-transformers ).   

AI Image Generation Service:

Model: Integrate with Stable Diffusion to ensure maximum artistic control.

API Integration: Connect to the built-in API provided by the AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui GitHub repository. This provides access to essential parameters like negative prompts, guidance scale, and ControlNet, which are critical for generating non-photorealistic "sketch" or "line art" style images.   

Programmatic Prompt Engineering: Create a module that synthesizes the outputs from the NLP pipeline (genre, topics, mood) into detailed positive and negative prompts for the Stable Diffusion API. The prompts should include stylistic keywords like "medieval manuscript marginalia," "minimalist line art," or "charcoal sketch" to guide the visual style.   

III. Frontend Implementation (JavaScript)

PDF Rendering:

Use Mozilla's PDF.js library to render each page of the source PDF onto an HTML <canvas> element. This transforms the static document into a manipulable web format. Reference the mozilla/pdf.js GitHub repository.   

Digital Book Interface:

Construct a two-page, book-style layout.

Implement a realistic page-turning animation. Reference the functionality of open-source libraries like turn.js as a model for the desired user experience.   

Dynamic Marginalia Placement:

Use the margin coordinate data calculated by the backend to dynamically position the AI-generated <img> elements using absolute CSS positioning.

Implement a simple collision detection algorithm to prevent images from overlapping in the margins.

IV. Database

Use PostgreSQL to store job statuses, extracted text chunks, NLP analysis results (genre, topics, mood scores), and the URLs or identifiers for the generated images, all linked by page number.
